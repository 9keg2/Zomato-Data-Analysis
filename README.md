# Zomato-Data-Analysis

🍜 Zomato Data Exploration & Visualization
Hey there! I'm 9keg2, and this is my deep dive into a Zomato dataset. In this project, I'm rolling up to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on zomato data. 

🚀 What's Going On Here?
I got my hands on a Zomato dataset, and I'm going to clean it, poke at it, and visualize the hell out of it to find some cool insights. Think of this repo as my data detective notebook.

What I'm Planning to Do:
- Data Wrangling: Clean the data and get it ready for analysis (handling missing values, weird formats, you know the drill).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Ask a bunch of questions and let the data do the talking.
- Data Visualization: I'll be using Seaborn and Matplotlib to create clean and informative charts and graphs. Gotta make those insights pop!
- Share Insights: At the end of it all, I'll lay out my findings—the good, the bad, and the interesting.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 

Libraries:
- pandas & numpy for data manipulation
- matplotlib & seaborn for creating visualizations
- plotly (maybevfor some interactive plots)

🔍 Some Questions I'm Trying to Answer.....

- Where are the most restaurant-dense areas?
- What's the average cost for two people? Does location play a big role?
- Which cuisines are the most popular and highest rated?
- Is there a relationship between price and rating?
- How does online delivery and table booking affect popularity?
- ...and whatever other questions pop into my head while I'm exploring.
